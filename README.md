<h1>GW0742 vs ACP-105 â€“ What Actually Works?</h1>

<p>I've cycled both <strong>GW0742</strong> and <strong>ACP-105</strong>. Theyâ€™re very different compounds. One boosts endurance like a rocket, the other gives you clean muscle with zero bloat. After running solo tests, hereâ€™s what I learnedâ€”no fluff, just what worked and what didnâ€™t.</p>

<h2>How I Tested These SARMs</h2>
<p>I donâ€™t go by hypeâ€”I test everything on myself. I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Endurance and VO2 max (I run 5Ks weekly)</li>
  <li>Lean muscle gains</li>
  <li>Body fat changes (DEXA scans)</li>
  <li>Side effects, recovery time, and sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Each compound was run for 6â€“8 weeks. No stacks. No changes in diet or training. Just clean data.</p>

<h2>What Is GW0742?</h2>
<p><strong>GW0742</strong> is a second-gen PPARÎ´ agonist, like Cardarine but more potent. Think of it like Cardarineâ€™s smarter, stronger cousin. Itâ€™s non-hormonal, so no suppression, and its main effects are on <strong>endurance, fat loss, and metabolism</strong>.</p>

<h3>My GW0742 Results</h3>
<p>I started noticing results within the first 10 days. My running time improved by nearly 1 minute by week 4. I was able to push longer in the gym without crashing, and fat just melted offâ€”especially around the waist. No crash, no stim jitter.</p>

<h3>GW0742 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Insane endurance boost (cardio + lifting)</li>
  <li>Fast, clean fat loss</li>
  <li>No suppression or PCT needed</li>
  <li>Stacks well with anything</li>
</ul>

<h3>GW0742 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not great for muscle gain</li>
  <li>Limited data compared to other SARMs</li>
  <li>Fatigue can come later in the day</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance, cardio performance</h4>

<h2>What Is ACP-105?</h2>
<p><strong>ACP-105</strong> is a SARM that gives lean muscle without heavy sides. Itâ€™s one of the cleaner SARMs out thereâ€”low suppression, dry gains, and quick recovery. I ran <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/acp-105-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this ACP-105 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My ACP-105 Results</h3>
<p>By week 3, my lifts started climbing and my muscles looked sharper. Not huge mass, but quality lean size. I added about 3.5 lbs of lean muscle in 6 weeks. I also recovered fasterâ€”DOMS was almost gone the next day, even after leg day.</p>

<h3>ACP-105 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Noticeable lean gains without water</li>
  <li>Boosts recovery and gym output</li>
  <li>Very low suppression</li>
  <li>No liver stress</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACP-105 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not strong enough for bulking solo</li>
  <li>Gains taper off around week 7â€“8</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Recomp, cutting, lean gains</h4>

<h3>My Verdict:</h3>
<p>If your goal is pure <strong>fat loss, cardio, or conditioning</strong>, go with <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742</a>. Youâ€™ll feel it fast, and itâ€™s zero hassle.</p>
<p>But if you want to stay anabolic, gain lean muscle, and cut at the same time, <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/acp-105-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACP-105</a> is the better tool.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>Can I stack GW0742 with ACP-105?</h3>
<p>Yes. It's a solid stackâ€”GW0742 for cardio/fat burn, ACP-105 for muscle preservation. No overlap or suppression issues.</p>

<h3>Which one burns more fat?</h3>
<p><strong>GW0742</strong>. It's a metabolic booster. Youâ€™ll see fat drop within weeks.</p>

<h3>Do I need PCT for these?</h3>
<p>GW0742: No. ACP-105: Not usually, unless you go longer than 8 weeks or are sensitive.</p>

<h3>Are these SARMs liver toxic?</h3>
<p>No. Both are non-methylated and safe on the liver when sourced right.</p>

<h3>How long before results show?</h3>
<p>GW0742: within 7â€“10 days (cardio boost). ACP-105: week 2â€“3 (strength and look).</p>

<h3>Which is better for women?</h3>
<p>Both are solid for women. But <strong>ACP-105</strong> may have more visible physique changes. GW0742 is perfect for performance and fat loss with no hormone issues.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Donâ€™t compare these like apples to apples. One is for performance and fat burn (<a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742</a>), and one is for actual muscle development (<a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/acp-105-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACP-105</a>).</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve run both solo. If youâ€™re cutting and want to stay anabolic, go ACP-105. If youâ€™re doing cardio or trying to get shredded fast, go GW0742. Or stack both and enjoy the synergy.</p>
<p>Keep it simple. Track your lifts, diet, and recoveryâ€”and youâ€™ll know exactly whatâ€™s working.</p>
